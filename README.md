# Unstopify

Unstopify is a macOS application that monitors Spotify playback and restarts Spotify when non-track or non-episode content is detected.

## Features
- Runs as a standalone macOS app
- Starts when opened, stops when quit
- Does NOT interfere with normal Spotify use when inactive
- Lightweight and local-only

## Installation
1. Download the latest release
2. Drag `Unstopify.app` into Applications
3. Open the app and confirm permissions

## Disclaimer
This project does not modify Spotify, inject code, or block content. It only monitors playback state and restarts the application when unexpected content is detected.
Additionally, if Unstopify is running, Spotify will automatically resume and relaunch if paused or closed.
